## Abstract
DataONE has consistently focused on interoperability among data repositories to enable seamless access to well-described data on the Earth and the environment.  Our existing services promote data discovery and access through harmonization of the diverse metadata specifications used across communities, and through our integrated data search portal and services.  In terms of the FAIR principles, we have done a good job at Findable and Accessible, while as a community we have placed less emphasis on Interoperable and Reusable.  We will present new DataONE services for quantitatively assessing metadata completeness and effectiveness relative to the FAIR principles. The services produce guidance for FAIRness at both the level of an individual data set and trends through time for repository, user, and funder data collections.
